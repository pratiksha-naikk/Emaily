Check it Out : (Emaily Streamlit)[https://emaily.streamlit.app/]

Hi there! I'm excited to introduce you to Emaily, a project born from the idea that communicating via email can be more intuitive, efficient, and tailored to each user's needs. Leveraging cutting-edge generative AI, Emaily aims to transform the way we think about email correspondence, whether it's drafting a new message or replying to one.

## Key Features

* Write an Email: Create custom emails suited to your needs, adjusting for tone and the nature of your relationship with the recipient.
* Reply to an Email: Generate thoughtful responses to your incoming emails, making sure each reply is appropriate and considerate.
* User-Friendly Interface: With a streamlined sidebar navigation, accessing Emaily’s functionalities is as simple as clicking a button.

## How Does Emaily Work?

At the heart of Emaily is the Google Generative AI model 'gemini-pro', which powers the email generation process. By inputting a few key details about your email's intended recipient, purpose, and preferred tone, Emaily crafts a personalized email or response designed to convey your message effectively and appropriately.
